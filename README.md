## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to tell a tale of poor security posture while showcasing the impact Drata's powerful Compliance as Code capabilities have in catching common IaC misconfigurations before they hit production. Whether you're a developer, a security professional, or just someone with a keen interest in cloud security, this repository is your playground for learning about the pitfalls to avoid in IaC!

_Before proceeding, please read the following disclaimer:_

> [!CAUTION]
> TerraFail contains multiple examples of intentionally insecure code displaying common IaC misconfigurations. These were developed with the intention of showcasing the impact of Drata's Compliance as Code engine on improving organizational security posture. The code and configurations in this repository are intended for educational purposes only. Do not use this code or these configurations in production environments. The authors of this repository take no responsibility for any damages that may result from the use of the code or configurations in this repository.

## Leveling Up

Now that you're painfully aware of all the compliance gaps in your infrastructure, you're probably wondering what comes next. Hours of research and investigation to understand these results and eventually fix them in your environment? What if I told you what comes next could be as simple as clicking a button and letting Compliance as Code do the work for you? **Code Review Pro** provides a way to configure automated PRs for your repositories that will remediate security flaws just as quickly as they were introduced. Fix your IaC misconfigurations and developer headaches in one go by setting up **Code Review Pro**.

## Setting up Code Review Pro

Let's go over how to set-up **Code Review Pro** to enable automated remediation using GitHub PRs:

1. **Remember this screen? If you haven't yet opted in to this feature your first step here will be upgrading to Pro so you can configure code review settings**

2. **After pro has been enabled, you'll see options for code review settings that can be used to configure automated PRs for code remediation**

   - select a minimum severity to trigger PR creation
   - group all issues into one PR or opt for separate PRs to be created for each failed test
